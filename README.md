# Product Inventory Contract

## Project Title
**Product Inventory Contract**

## Project Description
The Product Inventory Contract is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. It allows users to manage a product inventory by adding new products, retrieving product details, and updating stock quantities. This contract ensures transparency and immutability in inventory management, leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology.

## Project Vision
The vision of the Product Inventory Contract is to provide a transparent, secure, and efficient solution for managing product inventories. By utilizing blockchain technology, the project aims to eliminate discrepancies, reduce fraud, and streamline inventory processes for businesses of all sizes.

## Key Features
- **Add Product**: Allows the addition of new products to the inventory with details such as name, price, and quantity.
- **Get Product Details**: Enables retrieval of product information by product ID.
- **Update Stock**: Facilitates updating the stock quantity of existing products.
- **Product Count**: Provides the total number of products in the inventory.

## Future Scope
- **Multiple Products**: Extend the contract to handle multiple products by using mappings.
- **Price Updates**: Implement functions to update product prices.
- **Quantity Management**: Add functionality to update product quantities.
- **Access Control**: Introduce access control mechanisms to restrict certain functions to authorized users.
- **Frontend Integration**: Develop a user-friendly frontend interface to interact with the smart contract.
